# Wordy - a simple word guessing game ❓

Wordy is a little game, known by everyone. The rules are simple: you need to guess the word, you have 5 attempts to do that. Every time you are wrong, the right letters are highlighted (the right letters on the right places differ from misplaced ones).

- 🌱 **Simple:** The code is simple and straitforward, everyone with a little knowledge of Python is able to read and understand it.
- 🏙️ **Modern:** This project is written in modern Python, using modern and efficient FastAPI library to create the backend of the application.
- 📜 **Well-documented:** You don't need to guess what any part of code does, there is precise documentation for every class, method and function in the project.
- 🤖 **Fully-covered by tests:** The project needs to be error-proof, so that every time a change is done to the codebase, unit tests, which cover 100% percent of the code, will check it.
